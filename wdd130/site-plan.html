        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>To promote and provide information about the specialized services that Temple Inn and Suites offers
            to meet the needs of temple patrons, and their families, who come to serve in the temple or who 
            participate in events such as sealings, weddings, receptions, and youth trips.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The accommodations and services outlined in this site are for LDS temple patrons, workers, their 
            family members, and anyone willing to abide by the terms and policies outlined by the company.</p>
        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <h3>Website Logo</h3>

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/ffffff-38b6ff-393939-ff3232"
                target="_blank">https://coolors.co/ffffff-38b6ff-393939-ff3232</a></p>
        <table class="colors">
            <tr>
                <th>Primary</th>
                <th>Secondary</th>
                <th>Accent 1</th>
                <th>Accent 2</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="primary">#ffffff</td>
                <td class="secondary">#38b6ff</td>
                <td class="accent1">#393939</td>
                <td class="accent2">#ff3232</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: Josefin Sans</h4>
        <p>I am taking this font from the logo. I want there to be a uniform feel to the site; this only makes 
            sense as it will allude to the logo. I also want a clean, modern look and this will do it without 
            pushing too far.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Open Sans</h4>
        <p>This font pairs very well with the heading font. It accommodates to all visitors as it is easy to 
            read, it is clean, and goes with the modern look I want.</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our
            shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe
            alternative for your family.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from
            traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and
            freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
