      <h2>PARABELLUM</h2>
      <p>
        “Para bellum” is Latin, it means “prepare for war”. It comes from the old saying, or adage: 
        “Si vis pacem, para bellum”, meaning: “If you want peace, prepare for war”. Welcome to my site. The 
        vision I have for this site revolves around the every-day person. The person who is trying to better 
        their health but does not know where to start. Start here. The purpose of PARABELLUM Strength and 
        Health is to provide practical health and fitness advice and information, and to promote a sustainably 
        healthy lifestyle. I consider myself more of an enthusiast rather than an expert. What has motivated 
        this project has been the success I have had with basic advice I have taken from others added to my own 
        experiences. It all begins with a commitment, to yourself or to your loved ones, that you will push 
        yourself and achieve your goal. My first and main piece of advice is this: if you want better health, 
        para bellum!

        <h2>Strength and Health?</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you’re looking to lose weight or gain muscle, you should always strive to have a strong
          body. You will be more useful to society, you will be more prepared in case of an emergency, everyday
          physical tasks will become easier, you will enjoy a better life. I emphasize health because I see
          how unhealthy the fitness industry can be. Strive to be healthy, don’t buy into the smoke and mirrors of
          advertising. If you have good health you will feel better, you will act better, your body and mind
          will respond better. It’s not all about 'looking good'. It’s about improving your quality of life.
          Trust me, you can do it. </p>

        <h2>3 Pillars</h2>
        <p>
          There are three pillars in fitness, and to overall physical health: resting, nutrition, and exercise. 
          If you lack in one of these, the other two won't be as effective. Perhaps you have heard of this before;
          well, be conscious of it from now on. This is the foundation. This is where you can build a better
          physique and enjoy a healthier way of life. For some, this will be a war. There are things we can
          control in our everyday lives, there are things we cannot. You will need to control everything within
          your reach if you want success.

        <h2>Rest</h2>
        <p>
          This is a journey, so rest up. Aim for 8 hours of sleep every night and make sure you unwind after
          a long day or an intense workout. Rest is the reset button, don’t be afraid to use it.

        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
          You cannot outrun unhealthy eating habits. You cannot live your life on a diet either. Develop a
          sustainable and healthy nourishment plan. Food is your fuel, make it a lifestyle.

        <h2>Exercise</h2>
        <p>
          The keys to exercising are consistency, intensity, and proper form. Whatever you're aiming for,
          strength should be part of your goal. I will introduce you to resistance training and boxing.
