      <h2>Fuel Up</h2>
      <p>
        Food should be your fuel. It was designed to help you live; it should not take from you.
        Learn to look at food this way. Your body needs protein, carbs, veggies, fruits, even sugar and fat. So
        yes, you can still have a burger! I don't believe in diets simply because I don't believe
        they are sustainable in the long run; we are here for the long run. Let me give you some advice that
        has worked for me. This same advice helped me lose 20 pounds in 6 months. No fancy tricks. Just a commitment
        to being responsible and living by my nutrition battle plan.

        <h2>Make it</h2>
        <p>
          Cooking is a hassle for most of us, yet it is essential if you want success. Some things that have
          helped me are: replacing all oils (no more butter) with cooking grade olive oil, eating fresh veggies
          every meal (raw or cooked), eating only lean protein (vegetable/animal; no pork), limiting restaurant
          food as much as possible, and snacking on healthy foods. There are tons of free recipes and ideas online;
          go explore! This is a journey. This is how you build your nutrition foundation.

        <h2>Just Don't</h2>
        <p>
          Fried, microwaved, fast, frozen, greasy, canned. If more than 30% of your diet consists of foods that
          are described this way, or similarly, then it’s time to stop. You’re looking for a boost to kickstart
          your journey and these will only hold you back. Don’t give in to convenience, replace these food items
          with fresh foods and homemade meals. You don’t have to go vegan or organic, but you need to make the
          change now. It can be tough, but living unhealthy is tougher.

        <h2>The Key</h2>
        <p>
          Be responsible. You know what you buy and what goes into your body. Limit that which harms you. Yes,
          you can have the pizza or ice cream from time to time, but these should not sustain you. Aim for three
          meals a day. Three thought out meals. Do not overcomplicate them. You’re aiming for simple and easy to
          duplicate meals. Trust me, healthy does not mean tasteless or complex. It will be a challenge at first,
          but it gets a lot easier. Habits will get you farther than fads.

        <h2>Oatmeal</h2>
        <p>
          One of the best breakfast options. Easy to make, nutritious, and perfect for the on-the-go life.
          Try overnight oats and fresh fruit.

        <h2>Beef</h2>
        <p>
          Packed with protein, perfect choice for lunch. Make sure it’s the leanest you can find (or afford).
          (Or, go with plant protein, try lentils!)

        <h2>Fish</h2>
        <p>
          Great dinner choice. Low fat, high protein. Not to mention the omega-3 fatty acids.
          Try tilapia or salmon for muscle growth.

      <h2>Start Your Journey</h2>
      <p>
        You have to plan ahead if you’re looking to build something. This same principle applies to nutrition. Be 
        mindful of what you consume and make the plan that works for you. I have highlighted the basics, but you 
        must take the time to think, research, and apply. Figure out what works for you and remember there is a 
        world of difference between knowing and applying.
